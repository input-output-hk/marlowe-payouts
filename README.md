# Marlowe Payouts

<img align="right" src="public/images/marlowe-logo-primary.svg" >

Marlowe Payouts is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to help users discover payouts available for withdrawal from Marlowe contracts on the Cardano blockchain. With a user-friendly interface and seamless integration with the Cardano network, Marlowe Payouts simplifies the process of tracking and withdrawing your payouts.

This dApp was built using the [Marlowe-ts-sdk](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-ts-sdk), a robust SDK for Marlowe development on the Cardano blockchain.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- **Discover Payouts:** Easily find payouts available for withdrawal from Marlowe Contracts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and intuitive design ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Secure:** Built with the security and reliability of the Cardano blockchain in mind.

## Getting Started

To get the dApp up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-payouts
   cd marlowe-payouts

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install

3. **Run the dApp**
   ```bash
   npm run start

## Generating Payouts for Testing

To generate payouts for testing purposes on the preprod and preview networks, we recommend using the **Marlowe Starter Kit**. The starter kit provides comprehensive instructions and tools, including Jupyter notebooks, to help you understand and work with Marlowe contracts.

### Steps:

1. **Clone the Marlowe Starter Kit Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit.git
   cd marlowe-starter-kit

2. **Follow the Instructions**:
   Navigate to the [Marlowe Starter Kit repository](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit) and follow the provided instructions to set up and run the Jupyter notebooks.

3. **Generate Payouts**:
   To generate payouts specifically, refer to [Lesson 8 - CIP45](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-starter-kit/tree/main/lessons/08-cip45) in the starter kit. This lesson provides a detailed guide on how to generate payouts for Marlowe contracts.

By following the above steps, you can easily generate payouts for testing purposes and further explore the capabilities of Marlowe contracts on the Cardano blockchain.
